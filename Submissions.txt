1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?

Approx. 4-6 hrs split between multiple days.


2. Describe the features you have implemented.

While writing my program, I did my best to match both the format and functionality
of the example quiz that was provided to us.

In terms of format, noticeable features include:

- under the button logo that redirects to the publication's home page
- selectable options that respond to cursor hovering and clicking

In terms of functionality, following the criteria that's listed in the README, 
I implemented code that ensures that:

- there is at most 1 option selected at a time
- after clicking "show me my results," the form is no longer editable
- "show me my results" is correctly calculated based off of the user's input
- the "show me my results" button is only clickable after every question's answered
- the "retake quiz" button pops up after the user submits


3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.

I would say my main difficulties stemmed from making the quiz responsive
to changes in data.json. It definitely took me a while to come up with a way 
to deal with varying option lengths. Furthermore, since I was working with 
multiple state arrays that kept track of user selections, I had to take into 
consideration that setState is asynchronous and create workarounds to this factor.
I also experienced a bit of trouble from the fact that options within
data.json is actually an object, so I had to convert it to an array before
I could traverse through it.


4. How much time you can spend each week working for DP Developers?

Approx. 6-7 hours
